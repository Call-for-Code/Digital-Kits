Team,

A little while ago I reached out to you about an incredibly worthwhile developer challenge called Call for Code. It's a global developer challenge to improve natural disaster preparedness. There's a whole host of incredible prizes including deploying on-site in countries that desperately need ways to save lives.

If you've not yet singed up, now is the time!
[Sign up for the challenge here]

Make sure you accept the challenge and spend some time utilizing the free resources to learn about use cases, tutorials, and code patterns that can help you get started quickly on IBM Cloud at [developer.ibm.com/callforcode](developer.ibm.com/callforcode). There are specific focus areas like AI, Cloud, IoT, and Blockchain that will help you build up your knowledge and skills to get ready for our Call for Code day. Additionally, there are resources that provide guidance from subject matter experts in the areas of natural disasters and healthcare. 

Call for Code is a fantastic way for you to learn new skills while using technology to help solve one of mankind's biggest problems. I'm looking forward to kicking off our organization's contributions in our upcoming event.

Here are some additional videos for your reference to get you prepared for Call for Code Day:
