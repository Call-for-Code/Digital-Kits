**What am I signing up for?**  
Leaders who commit to the Cause are asked to forward emails, talk about the initiative, and drive general awareness of the cause within the company. There is no expectation to allow your developers the time to build Call for Code solutions during your organizations time, but would be appreciated by both Call for Code, and your developers.

**What do I have to do?**  
You'll receive a series of emails that we would like you to send to your developers, and as the project nears the end, developers who have signed up for Call for Code. They contain all of the information for your developers to become a part of Call for Code, as well as place to insert your unique tracking sign up for your developers.

<!-- finalize when process complete
**What is the unique tracking for?**
It's primary purpose is so you can send emails to those who have signed up, but it also serves as a way for you to measure engagement, help teams get formed, or really anything else you'd like to do with the data provided.
-->

**When do I have to do it by?**  
The emails have a suggested date on them. There are 4 emails to forward in total between when you Commit to the Cause and last email being sent approximately June 29th, 2019.

**What does my organization get by doing this?**  
You'll be officially recognized by the Call for Code initiative once you organization's twitter tweets with our hashtag and provided social image. If a significant amount of developers sign up using your unique code, you'll receive tickets to the award event in October, and if your developers win the challenge your company name will be announced at the award event.

**Are there example tweets for our organization to use?**  
Of course. Start with this and modify as you need but be sure to keep the #CallforCode hashtag:
It’s official [Org name] will Commit to the Cause. #CallforCode - Tasking our developers with solving some of the world’s greatest challenges. callforcode.org

**Aside from sending emails, what else can I do?**   
Once you receive the names of those who have volunteered their time, there is potentially some dedicated time that could be given to those individuals. They may also reach out to you as the person who sends the emails with questions, fielding them to the callforcode.slack.com would work. But you can be as hands-on as you'd like!  

**Aside from sending emails, what else can my organization do?**  
If you're able to have your developers spend your organizations time on this initiative, and would like to schedule a formal event to kick off their coding efforts, then we would suggest looking at "Push for Change".
