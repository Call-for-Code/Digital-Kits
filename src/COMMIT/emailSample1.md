Team,

Call for Code 2019 is here! Call for Code is a global challenge that encourages the more than 23 million developers around the globe to come together using technology to solve some of the worlds greatest problems. I'm proud that, as a company, we are committing to this cause and will run a Call for Code day on [insert date]. The objective of Call for Code is to create sustainable open-source solutions that significantly improve preparedness for natural disasters and accelerate relief when they hit. This year, the emphasis is on individual health and community well-being. This includes solutions that can:

1. Reduce the risk of disease
2. Improve access to data and the availability of resources
3. Address the mental health needs of those impacted before, during, and after disasters

The inaugural year of Call for Code was a huge success with more than 2,500 solutions created by over 100k developers from 156 Nations, with many solutions being developed that will help all of us be better prepared for natural disasters. The 2018 Call for Code winner, [Project Owl](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-06/ibm-backed-project-creates-wi-fi-network-for-natural-disasters) is currently being tested and deployed in Puerto Rico as part of IBM's Code and Response inititive. You can learn more about what Project Owl is doing in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7aAdk87Yv8).

On average, **every day** natural disasters will directly impact 80,000 people, costing the global economy more than $270 million. What if technology could help improve these figures? That's exactly what Call for Code is setting out to do. It asks developers to work out how to use AI, Blockchain, Cloud, Data, and IoT technologies most effectively to improve communities' disaster preparedness and resiliency.

This is a competitive challenge, but unlike any other hackathon, the winners will work with IBM's Code and Response team to deploy the solution in 2020. As a company, I'd be proud to announce that we have a team of developers among our ranks who're changing the world for the better.

In addition to the deployment, the winner will receive:
* An invitation for each team member to the *Call for Code Global Announcement* in October, including travel.
* A $200,000 USD cash prize.
* Long-term open source project support from the Linux Foundation.
* Opportunity for mentorship and investment in the solution.

You can find out the details of all the prizes and the specifics of the challenge at [https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) and make sure to Accept the Call for Code Challenge.

This is a truly worthwhile project, and I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of you at our Call for Code Day.
