Team,

Last year, Call for Code was a phenomenal success, and I'm proud to tell you that as a lab, we will run a 2019 Call for Code Day on **[insert date]**. IBM is the founding partner in the 2019 Call for Code Global Challenge, which supports the United Nations Human Rights office, and The American Red Cross.

This year, natural disasters are expected to impact 80,000 people directly, costing the global economy more than $270 million. What if technology could help improve these figures? That's where Call for Code comes in. The challenge seeks to inspire developers to use AI, Blockchain, Cloud, Data, and IoT technologies to improve communities' disaster preparedness, response and resiliency.

This year, we added an implementation component, Code and Response, which is the framework through which IBM is putting these winning solutions into production. We've already begun this effort with last year's Call for Code winner, Project Owl. 

Like last year, there will be a separate challenge for IBMers and I would love to see a team from this lab among the top IBM projects.

You can learn more about the specifics of the challenge at callforcode.org, and we'll be following up shortly with another email about pre-event training that you should complete before our Call for Code Day.

This is a truly worthwhile project, and I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at our Call for Code Day.
