**What are the IBM labs doing for Call for Code?**  
Each lab will select a lab focal, who will work with the lab leader, to promote and run a formal initiative with developers in the lab. The initiative kicks off with a Call for Code day, followed by additional time spent by developers in the lab to build and submit their Call for Code solutions to the IBMer challenge. The focal will work with the Call for Code core team to schedule and run the Call for Code day.

**What do I have to do?**  
You'll receive a kit that contains digital content to help you plan and execute the Call for Code day as well as email templates to use to keep the drumbeat going in your organization around the Call for Code. The emails contain all of the information the lab developers to become a part of Call for Code IBMer challenge.

**When do I have to do it by?**  
The Call for Code day, will be run in IBM labs in late June and early July. Members of the Call for Code core team in IBM will work with you on the specific schedule. Each of the nurture emails have specific recommended dates for when to send them.

**What resources are available to help me?**
In the digital content you will find a field guide that you can follow or adapt as appropriate for your organization that will help you run the Call for Code day. There be online preparatory training for the lab developers to attend to learn about the use cases and reference code patterns. There will be some supporting goodies available like t-shirts, stickers and banners that you can use to make it a great event. Finally, members of the IBM Call for Code core team will come to the lab and provide assistance to lab developers during the event.

**Are there example tweets for our lab to use?**  
Of course. Start with this and modify as you need but be sure to keep the #CallforCode hashtag:
It’s official [Lab name] is responding to the #CallforCode - Tasking our developers with solving some of the world’s greatest challenges. callforcode.org

**Aside from running the Call for Code day and sending emails, what else can I do?**  
After the Call for Code day has completed, keep in mind that the journey has just started. Advocate for those individuals who have volunteered their time to participate in the Call for Code day to get a little more dedicated time to work on their projects. They may also reach out to you as the person who sends the emails with general questions, be sure to have them discuss these in the internal #call-for-code slack channel available in the IBM Organization slack.
