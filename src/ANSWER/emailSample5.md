**Body:**

Team,

I wanted to reach out to you personally to thank you for your participation in Call for Code. Submissions have closed and the judging will begin, and I'm hoping that we'll have one of our organization's projects selected as finalists or even challenge winners.

[Include only if you have been notified of tickets: Based on our organization's participation, I wanted to make you aware that we have a limited number of Call for Code award event tickets available. It's on October 13th featuring ... stay tuned!!]

I'm confident you've all done an incredible job and you've found this a fun and worthwhile experience, and if you've had a great experience with any of the technology you've used, I'd love to hear from you.
