Team,

I'd like to extend my personal thanks to everyone who came together for our Call for Code Day last week. Everyone put their hearts, minds, and time into answering the call. Let's keep the momentum going and take the input you've received and apply it to make your solution rock solid and ready to submit.

I encourage you to continue meeting with your team regularly to draw up a plan, finalize your projects, and submit by July 29th, 2019. Check with your manager (forward this email if you like) about getting some discretionary time set aside for your work on this project as it aligns with our corporate responsibility initiatives.

This is a great opportunity for developers to showcase how a small team can make a difference by creating sustainable open-source solutions to help mitigate the effects of natural disasters.
