**What am I signing up for?**  
Leaders who sign up to Push for Change, are committing to partner, with some help from IBM, to promote and run a formal initiative within their organization. The initiative kicks off with a Call for Code day, followed by additional time spent by developers in your organization to build and submit their Call for Code solutions. You decide when and where to host the Call for Code day, as well as the quantity of developers from your organization that will participate.

**What do I have to do?**  
You'll receive a kit that contains digital content to help you plan and execute the Call for Code day as well as email templates to use to keep the drumbeat going in your organization around the Call for Code. The emails contain all of the information for your developers to become a part of Call for Code, as well as place to insert your unique tracking sign up for your developers.

<!-- finalize when process complete
**What is the unique tracking for?**  
It's primary purpose is so you can send emails to those who have signed up, but it also serves as a way for you to measure engagement, help teams get formed, or really anything else you'd like to do with the data provided.

**When do I have to do it by?**  
The Call for Code day, which runs much like a short hackathon, takes several weeks to plan depending on the size and scope. It should be held with enough time to allow at least 3 more weeks of solution development before the challenge closing date of July 29th, 2019.

**What is IBM providing to help?**
In the digital content you will find a field guide that you can follow or adapt as appropriate for your organization that will help you run the Call for Code day. IBM will provide free online training for your developers to attend to learn about the use cases and reference code patterns. And, IBM will send you a box of items (think: T-shirts, stickers, and more) that you can use to make it a great event.

**What does my organization get by doing this?**  
You'll be officially recognized by the Call for Code initiative once you organization's twitter tweets with our hashtag and provided social image. If a significant amount of developers sign up using your unique code, you'll receive tickets to the award event in October, and if your developers win the challenge your company name will be announced at the award event.

**Are there example tweets for our organization to use?**  
Of course. Start with this and modify as you need but be sure to keep the #CallforCode hashtag:
It’s official [Org name] will Push for Change. #CallforCode - Tasking our developers with solving some of the world’s greatest challenges. callforcode.org

**Aside from running the Call for Code day and sending emails, what else can I do?**  
After the Call for Code day has completed, keep in mind that the journey has just started. Advocate for those individuals who have volunteered their time to participate in the Call for Code day to get a little more dedicated time to work on their projects. They may also reach out to you as the person who sends the emails with general questions, fielding them to the [callforcode.slack.com](callforcode.slack.com) would work.

**How can I communicate with IBM and other Captains leading the Push for Change in their organization?**  
After you register your organization in the Push for Change, you will receive a link to join the Call for Code slack where you will be added to a private channel shared by other Captains and the IBM Call for Code team. This slack channel will also allow you to get first notifications of updates and new content to help with your delivery of the Call for Code day.
