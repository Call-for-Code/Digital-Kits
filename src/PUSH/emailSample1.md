Team,

I wanted make you all aware of a developer-focused global challenge to help improve disaster preparedness using technology. It's called Call for Code, and I'm proud to tell you that as a company, we are committing to this cause and will run a Call for Code day on [insert date]. Call for Code is supporting the UN Human Rights office, and The International Network of The American Red Cross, with the technology being provided for free by IBM.

On average, **every day** natural disasters will directly impact 80,000 people, costing the global economy more than $270 million. What if technology could help improve these figures? That's exactly what Call for Code is setting out to do. It asks developers to work out how to use AI, Blockchain, Cloud, Data, and IoT technologies most effectively to improve communities' disaster preparedness and resiliency.

This is a competitive challenge, but unlike any other hackathon, the winners will be working with The American Red Cross and IBM's Corporate Service Corps to deploy the solution in 2019. I'd be proud to announce that we have a team of developers among our ranks who're changing the world for the better.

On top of the deployment, other rewards include:
* An all-inclusive invitation for each team member to the *Call for Code Global Prize Event* in October.
* A significant cash prize.
* Long-term open source project support from the Linux Foundation.
* The opportunity to meet one-on-one with a venture capitalist.

You can find out all the details of the prizes and the specifics of the challenge at callforcode.org, but make sure you sign up for the challenge using the link above. It's a unique sign up for us, and will let us track and help you progress.

This is a truly worthwhile project, and I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of you at our Call for Code Day.
